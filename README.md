# Rust Learning Projects

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! This repository contains hands-on projects, exercises, and experiments as I explore and master the Rust programming language. Each folder represents a standalone project or concept designed to deepen my understanding of Rust's powerful features, safety guarantees, and modern systems programming capabilities.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- **Beginner Projects:** Simple CLI tools, basic data structures, and Rust syntax practice.
- **Intermediate Concepts:** Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, pattern matching, enums, traits, and modules.
- **System-Level Projects:** Working with file I/O, concurrency (threads, channels), and error handling.
- **Web & Async:** Experimentation with crates like `tokio`, `reqwest`, and basic HTTP services.
- **Performance & Safety:** Benchmarking and optimizing code, understanding zero-cost abstractions.
